# REST API - Top Racing Games

This API works for the Top Racing Games site, is built with NodeJS and Express, manages both article and user information, and saves the data in MongoDB Atlas through Mongoose.

This REST API is deployed in the Heroku service, uses the JSON Web Token library to manage user sessions, their data, and the encryption of their passwords to save them in the database in MongoDB Atlas.
